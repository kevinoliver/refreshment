# refreshment

A Chrome browser extension for automatically refreshing tabs.

## Installation

Install locally using [an unpacked extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked). 
Doing so requires cloning this repo and then loading it in Chrome.

## Usage

In a tab you want refreshed, click on the extension's toolbar icon. The icon may be hidden inside the toolbar's extension menu (ðŸ§©).  

## Why

TODO: explain why this instead of the existing browser extensions that refresh tabs.
